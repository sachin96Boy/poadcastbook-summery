It originally aired as a YouTube video, and you can watch all of our YouTube videos at youtube.com/a16z videos.",It is Frank Chen from a16z podcast. This is the part two of ‘What's next for education startups’. You can watch all of our YouTube videos at youtube.com/a16z videos.
2,"Hi, this is Frank Chen, welcome to the a16z network. Very excited today to share a conversation I had with Connie Chan, one of our general partners. Connie is one of the world's experts on trends, especially consumer trends in China and Tech. And today we're going to talk about the future of lifelong learning and she's going to share a few examples of very awesome startups in China. She's super interested in what's happening with Gen Z consumers. She's very interested in real estate and how people are finding homes, preparing their homes to be listed on Airbnb, renting homes, so on and so forth. She's also very inspired by things that entrepreneurs are doing in China that might have applicability here in the United States. She helped us find our investments in Line and Pinterest, and I think you're going to really enjoy this conversation that I had with Connie. I have to tell you a funny story before we get started. So we did not synchronize our sweaters. We've known each other so long. We just knew to come in the same color family. So Connie was my first hire at Andreessen Horowitz. Adam Rifkin introduced us. Adam at one time and may still be the most connected person on LinkedIn and his whole heart and mission is to connect people. So when I told Adam I was looking for the best deal partner ever, he went and found Connie. And I'm so thrilled that you've been here for so long and now are a general partner looking to make investments. So welcome.","Today we're going to talk about the future of lifelong learning with Connie Chan, who is one of the world's experts on trends, especially consumer trends in China and Tech.

3,Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you so much.
4,"So today we're going to continue our series in education and talk a little bit about ongoing education and we're so excited about the things that we can do as adults to continue to learn new things and for those of you that know me, like learning a new thing is my favorite thing in life. So I'm so excited about this episode. So Connie, why don't you set the context and let's talk a little bit about the things that are working, especially in China and I thought maybe it'd be good to just anchor on how much money and how many users people spend on adult education because this is very surprising.","In this episode of our education series, we are going to talk about ongoing education and the things that we can do as adults to continue to learn new things. So Connie, let's talk a little bit about the things that are working, especially in China, how much money and how many people spend on adult education."
5,"Yeah. I think about education and learning in a way that goes well beyond K through 12. So I'm actually hyper focused on education for adults, people once they have graduated college. How can they use online education for self improvement for example, and if you look at the dollars abroad, I do a lot of studying what's working in China and working in Asia to give me inspiration for ideas here in the States. That's a massive market in Asia, it's massive in China. And I think it's because China has developed all these online education platforms that are specifically made for mobile, that unlock all these other new features and benefits. And in terms of how big it is, my research says that right now online education in China has 150 million users, and expected to grow to nearly 300 million by the year 2020. It's a $40 billion industry, expected to grow to $70 billion. Of course, this is a very broad categorization of what counts as education. But what's interesting is the way that these research reports break it up. The largest group is not K through 12. It's not even college students, the largest groups of students who want to do self improvement and online education, they are 26 to 35.","So I think about education and learning in a way that starts from birth and goes through our life and, really focuses on how we can use different technologies for self-improvement. My studies what's working in China and Asia gives me inspiration for ideas here in the States. Actually it’s a massive market there. Online education in China has 150 million users, and expected to grow to nearly 300 million by the year 2020. It's a $40 billion industry, expected to grow to $70 billion. The interesting thing that my research reports me is that the largest groups of students who want to do self-improvement and online education, they are 26 to 35. Not even college students."
6,"That's super interesting. So you would expect sort of the Asian cultures that the parents sending their students to, you know, after school enrichment programs, and so you think that's where all the money is going, but you're saying, look, it's after they graduate college.","It’s interesting. So, you are saying that after they graduate from college, students from Asian cultures are more likely to enrol in enrichment programs, that’s where there parents invents money right?"
7,"Right, right. And I think that's because if you take the word education and you expand it just to self improvement, self learning, then it greatly increases the demographic that you can address. And yes, a lot of people will just say China education. It's huge, because parents spend so much money, on tutoring, and so forth, because of the way the college system works. But most of that money is actually going through post-college graduates.","Yes it is, because they take the education to self-improvement and self-learning, And yes lot of people for example in China, parents spend money on education, especially through post college graduates."
8,"It's really interesting, because in China, what's already happening is what we sort of expect to happen here. Which is today, we have this system where sort of you go through K through 12. And then a subset of those people go to college and then basically at age 22, you're done. There's no more formal education and now it's basically the workplaces job to train you, right? They'll send you to classes and so on, and we know that's going to change we know that the world is so dynamic now, that you can't learn everything that you need to be a productive worker or citizen by age 22. You're going to have to learn ongoing - this is sort of a big part of our investment thesis behind Udacity.","Yeah, so in China, you're seeing people do not stop their education typically in age 22, because they realize that they need to keep learning in order to stay competitive in the workforce."
9,"And there's a bunch of courses that a college curriculum will likely never include, like how to conduct ourselves at a meaning, how to speak publicly. Right. How to how to like train your kid - that counts as education, parenting courses that counts as education, you’ll never cover that stuff in college.","There's also a lot of vocational training that you can't get in college such as how to conduct ourselves at a meaning, public speaking skills. Those are also the education."
10,"Yeah. And in addition to sort of the Evergreen stuff that you mentioned, like, you know, everybody needs to be a good public speaker. Everybody needs to know how to be. There's also sort of topical things that emerge as marketplaces emerge. So I'm thinking about the Taobao sellers, right? So Taobao was like eBay here. And what happened in Taobao was there were sellers who were experimenting with the system, and they kind of figured out what was working for them. And they would share online and in videos and Taobao saw this happening, and they're like, oh, let's actually get behind this and push right, let's set up Taobao University, where we can take our very best sellers and actually have them make money from their content, not just their markets.","And so what you see in a lot of these marketplaces is that the people who are the best at it, the people who are the most successful, are the ones who are sharing their knowledge. And so it's not just about, you know, being a good public speaker or being a good marketer right?"
11,"Yeah, completely.",Of course.
12,So awesome. So why do you think this is happening already in Asia? Why are they ahead?,"So what are the reasons that you think, this is happening already in Asia?"
13,"I think Asia is in general, much more mobile first, and mobile-only an environment in the States. Meaning that if I asked you to go buy a pair of shoes, you might nationally flock to your computer to get the best flows or experience. But in Asia, you pull up your phone and you'd open the team or the Taobao app. And the idea that your PC and phone are completely interchangeable and you can completely rely on your phone to get you everything you need is more prevalent in Asia. There's also more mobile payments and the idea of paying on your phone is very natural and common to people, not just in tier one cities but across the country. But I think there's three core breakthroughs and insights that Asia has really figured out that has propelled its education work, it's so much more forward. The first one is that they rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning and in a much more interesting way. So that allows them to unlock products and features and just ideas that I don't see here in the state. So for example, there's this company called Lingochamp and it teaches you English. And typically when you look at a language learning app here in the States, it's very flashcard driven, or it will give you a sentence and you can read it. But in Asia they realize that people want to learn English not just to be able to read and write but more importantly to have conversations and be able to visit the world to interact with other people. And so they use the mobile phone and the microphone to allow you to speak directly into the app and read out sentences and actually carry on conversations with a computer that will speak back to you. And that kind of scoring using machine learning and artificial intelligence allows people to learn pronunciation with a standalone mobile app, and I think that's a fantastic example of like leaning into artificial intelligence and machine learning to dramatically reduce the cost. This company Lingochamp, their gross margins are over 70%. Because they don’t have a teacher cost.","First I think the reason for that is people in Asia are much more mobile first, which means, not like in States, they use mobile phone for the tasks such as payments, online shopping rather than the computer. Second is that Asia has really figured out how to personalize learning in a much more interesting way. So they're using technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to do it. With the mobile phone and new technologies, they enhance the quality of the education and the learning while reducing the cost."
14,"Right. So nobody has to sort of say “oh, that's a terrible accent”. My Funny story on this is when I was learning Chinese Mandarin, my Mandarin teacher said, asked me one day, “are you from Hong Kong?"", which for those of you that don't realize it, is probably the most grievous insult that you could hurl at somebody trying to learn Mandarin because it's so bad. So, so you're saying look, they didn't have to have a teacher listening to you and then giving guidance. They're using the machine learning to say “you don't sound like a native and here's where”.","Of course, I think that that's actually really powerful with this machine learning technologies, because it can help you to improve your pronunciation in real time a lot faster than you would be able to otherwise."
15,"right and because their gross margins are so high, their price point is so much lower than having a real life tutor or even an online course instructor tutor. Their price point is so affordable that people all around the country can access it. And that same concept of leaning into machine learning is also true in music as another category. There's this company in China called paleo and paleo in Chinese translates to, they will practice piano or practice an instrument alongside you. And what it is, is a mobile app which has a piano teacher. And this app, you put it on the stand and you attach it to your piano and this teacher can help your kid age five through 16, learn an instrument - they do piano, violin, a bunch of classical Chinese instruments. But again, it's that price point that they're able to unlock. Because for a lot of these music instructors, so much about cost as in their travel time, or because you're living in a city where the cost of living is just so high, but now in China, my teacher doesn't have to live in Beijing. They don't have to live in Shanghai, they can live anywhere in the country. They don't even have to live in China. Right. And then not only is that the case they use the machine learning aspect to help the teachers with scoring the kids and scoring the performance, because of music, just like with language, there is actual pitch, there is an actual tempo and actual rhythm that you're supposed to play. Right so they can take the composition score, and then hear your actual performance and give you a grade, which then allows one teacher to teach two or three students at the same time, which that alone is even more cost savings, allowing more parents to give their kids these music lessons that they would typically not be able to afford.","Yes, there is another main point which is cost. With this technologies it is so affordable that people all around the country can access it. This concept of leaning is also true in music as another category, because for a music instructors, it is so much about cost as in their travel time. But with this technology these teachers can live anywhere in the country. Also what is interesting abbot these application is that it can give real time feedback about our performance, so it is very useful."
16,"I'm flashing back to my piano learning days and I'm hearing that “too fast, too fast”. Right? So now we can do that with machine learning.",It’s really interesting because we can get our grade at the same time we learn.
17,"Right and imagine being able to do that during practice sessions, right and having that information sync up to the teacher. There's just a lot more we can do with machine learning, especially when it comes to language and music, that is still I think, very untapped here in the west.","Absolutely, you know it is really important to having that information sync during practice sessions to the teacher. Using this machine learning technique we can do more intersecting learning that are still not touched in the west."
18,"So let's talk a little bit about sort of the efforts that we've sort of seen here and sort of how you think we get from here, where we are, so we have learning platforms like Masterclass, we have learning platforms like Udemy, we have learning companies like Udacity, one of our portfolio companies. What's sort of missing from those that sort of the next generation of EdTech startups you're looking for? You think we'll have?","Okay, let’s talk about the ongoing system here in the west and what we have missed in our huge learning platforms like Udemy, Udacity and Masterclass. What do you think about that?"
19,"Yeah, I think the answer is one word. It's mobile. And the reason is because mobile-only is a society that I think is inevitably in our future. And when you have mobile that allows for all kinds of different things - that allows again for microphone input, as an example. Everyone has a camera or front facing and a back-facing camera on our phones, which allows for different kinds of input and interaction with a platform. Mobile allows you to have these bite-sized snacks, rather than opening your Instagram newsfeed, maybe you can take a three minute class or a five minute class whenever you have downtime. And also Mobile allows people to not feel like you have to be confined to a video format. And I think this is really critical because a lot of long tail expertise doesn't always naturally sink video. For example, you can be a math teacher and yes, you're writing formulas on the board or you can be a philosophy teacher, right, and you can be sitting there giving a lecture, just sitting there. Or that same kind of content can be also conveyed through a podcast or an audio format. And once you're focused on mobile, you are not thinking like, it has to be video, it has to be full screen immersive. That now can also be a podcast that you listen to when you're driving to work, when you're walking to work. And again, I think that that expansion of formats is really obvious once you make something that is mobile centric.","The answer is very easy and straightforward. It’s mobile. We have missed the concept o mobile learning in these huge learning platforms. Using a mobile we can do learning easily you know you can hear a learning podcast while walking down the street which cannot be done with a computer. And also the learning materials need not to be the quality videos, you can be a math teacher and you can be sitting in front of the camera of the mobile giving a lecture, just sitting there. Likewise we can use the tools in a mobile for better learning."
20,"So we haven't seen the class of mobile first EdTech that you were expecting to see, which is pretty surprising, right? It's sort of it is sort of an obvious insight once you say it out loud like you did. And so.",So we haven't seen the learning of mobile first right?
21,"I think I think the reason is because so much of EdTech has been either you pay this one-time very expensive tuition. Or honestly, it's ad-based, right? Like YouTube is the biggest university in the world. And most of the creators are monetizing through advertisements. But because it's ad-based, a lot of the content on YouTube can't go to the depth of expertise that you need to really make a big impact on your life or your career. Because the creators, they have these incentives to have to create content that gets lots of clicks. And the reality is a lot of self improvement, lifelong learning content is not all clickbait content, right and to go into that depth of what you need to know, ad format is not the best way to compensate these creators. So for example, if you're buying a house for the first time, you need to understand how to think through that transaction. It doesn't make sense for someone to create these ad-based videos because one, they're not going to get all the clicks they need to justify their time and expertise. But I mean, imagine a platform where someone could package that in 20-30 courses, it could be a mixture of audio and PDF, video, a live stream Q&A, a paid one-on-one consultation and put that all in one format, for that creator now to make much more money and have the right incentives to create deeper, better content.","Yes, and so I think there is a big reason, is that a lot of eduaction platforms people use such as YouTube, they're not really built for that type of content or Education. Whereas with a platform someone could package that in 20-30 courses, it's built specifically for educators and for content creators who want to create content that is really going to help people improve their lives and their careers. And so that's a big reason why I think those are the platforms that is really focused on quality content and not just getting clicks."
22,"So that makes perfect sense, right which is it takes a lot of work to create this content. And if you're monetizing with advertising, that means only the top 1% are going to even break even or barely breakeven on all of that effort, right? Because you need to attract 10s of millions of people.","Definitely, it makes perfect sense which it takes a lot of work to create this content to get the user clicks. Because you need to attract people to enhance your profit right."
23,"And ads reward production value. Right? So you need the great videographer there and you need to spend an hour on your YouTube thumbnail. That's not right. Because honestly, a lot of these great experts, a lot of these professors, these doctors, these nutritionist, they are not media experts, right? And the fact that they have to go hire videographers, buy very expensive equipment, cameras lighting, what have you, learn how to edit videos themselves for the first time, that’s not long term, I think going to work because these creators are being underpaid for their knowledge.",And the ads reward production value. So these creators need to spend an hour on their YouTube thumbnail and video also they need expensive equipment like cameras and lights. But the actual teachers don’t have that much time to work on videos. They don’t even need to learn how to edit videos.
24,"So as I think about my own sort of ongoing education habits, YouTube has definitely become one of them. Which is to say I'm watching TED talks. I did something over the holidays, which I'm very proud of which is I placed a doorknob. And I'm proud of this because I'm like the least handy person I know. And so I watched a YouTube video and went to Home Depot and in my in-laws house, I replaced the little doorknob mechanism. Yes, I did it! And so you're saying, I should do that. But I was like giddily proud of myself. Because like I'm a software person, and that was definitely hardware. Okay. So anyway, thank you for indulging my burst of enthusiasm for myself there. So you're saying look, that type of content that's fine for YouTube because like that's super easy, right?","Yeah. I think that that's a great example of something that's easy to learn from a YouTube video. And I think that that's something that a lot of people might be interested in but, you are saying that we should follow a real education platform even though we follow these platforms such as YouTube too."
25,"And it’s visual and you need to see which part to change out, which nail to take out.","Yes, it is visual but you need to use other ways also."
26,Ads for that makes sense. But it doesn't make sense for the sort of highly produced package where I'm teaching you something that's a more serious life skill.,Ads make sense but it doesn’t make sense when learning or teaching ver important life skills.
27,"I mean, like TED talks are fantastic intro course, as a first great lecture. But there should be 10 lectures beyond that for every topic. Right? Right. And a lot of things that are skill based in particular, I think deserve having title courses, 20 courses, 30 courses, so on. Yeah, and there's a lot of things that I would be willing to pay for. I love to pay to figure out how can I improve my voice. I would love to pay to say, how can I improve parenting and so forth. And there aren't great platforms right now that make it as easy as creating like a Shopify website for these creators to monetize their knowledge. And these creators, typically, one - they're not media experts, two - they're not technologists, so they don't have time to build their own blogs or their own websites and integrate PayPal or credit card payments into them. And the biggest problem is they're truly underpaid right now for the knowledge that they're freely sharing on YouTube.","Yeas these youtube videos are really great if it contain even 10 lectures for each topic. And also people likes to enhance their presentation skills, communication skills and those should also be there. There so many great platforms which provides these coyrses like Shopify, but the biggest problem is the people who create that courses are not media experts, two - they're not technologists, so they don't have time to build their own blogs or their own websites and integrate PayPal or credit card payments into them."
28,"If you think about sort of an example that is in this ecosystem, you think about Masterclass, right, where the entrepreneur is doing a great job of sort of hoovering up all of the top experts in their fields. And I think part of the reason they went top down is sort of the same reason that Elon Musk went to the Roadster first and then the S and then the X and then the 3, right, so He's working his way down. And I think part of that is because I wonder if there's enough cultural support in the West for paying for education of this kind, right? So it sounds like in China, you already have that cultural support. So like what is education amongst household expenses? Is it like number three or number four after housing and medical? Right, so you have this inbred, sort of support cultural support. Like of course, I'm paying for education, right. And so it once mobile content sources sprung up, the money just went, right. And so, what do you think is going to happen here? Do we need more cultural support? How does that interaction happen?","I think there's definitely cultural support for paying for education in China. I wonder if there's enough cultural support in the West for paying for education of this kind, right. There's definitely a lot of cultural support for paying for education, but I think it would take a lot to get people to trust the government enough to invest in education. So do we need more cultural support? How does that interaction happen?"
29,"I think the way that way Silicon Valley and platforms can help encourage this shift for lifelong learning and self improvement as is really breaking away from just the app-based model and finding the right incentives for creators to be able to monetize because I think a lot of creators when they have an ability to make a significant amount of income from sharing their expertise, they will create better content. And as there's better content out there, users will say, “Hey, this is a fantastic way to put a small investment into myself”. Right? And right now, the platforms I think are not doing enough to help those creators monetize. For a platform, that doesn't just mean changing their business model. It also means monetizing their own brand and becoming a mainstream app and mainstream website. And that's really important because, for a lot of these platforms, they shouldn't have just one teacher teaching you how to sing. There should be 20-30 teachers, and then there should be rankings based off of student reviews or based on people who actually completed the course. Right? And repeat students and so forth, and all those things should help bubble up the best teacher and these platforms to do a lot to invest in building out their own brands to become mainstream in order to do that. And, and I love the Masterclass content. I think once they expand, they're going to have to include more teachers for the same thing.","I completely agree. I think that one of the issues with platforms like Masterclass is that oftentimes, the teachers are really good. But there are only a certain number of them, and so you might not have access to the teacher that you want. And I also think that it's important for platforms to have a variety of teachers. So, I think that it's important for platforms to invest in their own brands and to become mainstream."
30,To go down market. It doesn't have to be Steve Martin teaching you how to do comedy. It'll be your local comedy genius.,To go down market. It doesn't need to be a big name. It can be you. You don't need the big name to do it.
31,"Or it could be all of them together, right? And they could be priced at different price points. And then when you go the level beyond Steve Martin, you can have them ranked differently. Right and I love to be able to figure out what are the rankings for classes that people finished? What are the rankings where people get the highest reviews? Right? What are the rankings based off price, what have you, right? And all of that kind of data is totally presentable right now, it's just not being surfaced by the platform.","All of the data is presentable right now, it's just not being surfaced by the platform. It could be all of them together, right? And they could be priced at different price points. And then when you go the level beyond Steve Martin, you can have them ranked differently."
32,"Another sort of age old challenge in sort of building these pervasive education marketplaces in the past has been you sort of have very broad categories of education there, sort of, let's call it hobby entertainment, right? I'm learning the piano, I want to sing better, right? And then there's sort of business self improvement. Like I want to learn how to use Excel better or I want to be a better offer up seller or something like that. So do you think that there's going to be one platform that sort of wins both? Do you think there'll be more specialty things that sort of cater to each of these because it feels like they have different dynamics?",I think there will be more specialty platforms. And I think there's a lot of different ways that people want to learn and a lot of different ways that platforms can cater to those different ways of learning. So do you think that there's going to be one platform that sort of wins both?
33,"I think it's possible, but it's unclear how the future will shake out. I mean, for example, I think there's a lot of great workout apps today already, right? That put a bunch of fitness instructors or nutritionists up against each other and you can choose which instructor you want. And they have that category down pretty well. But I also think it's very possible if there was a platform that created the right tools - I know this like Shopify in a box - where I can say here on my podcast, here are my blog posts. These are the times when I'm going to do a live stream Q&A. This is the PDF of the book I willing to sell. Right? If it gave creators these options to just turn on these modules and create their own knowledge store. I think it's possible also to have one major platform as well.","Yeah it is possible. I mean, they've really created this incredible ecosystem where you can find anything. But I also think it's very possible if there was a platform that created the right tools such as Shopify in a box. So this is definitely something that would be possible with the right modules in place."
34,That serves both sort of the hobbyist entertainment market as well as the serious self improvement market.,That serves both the entertainment market as well as the self-improvement market.
35,"Yeah, it's possible it's not a new startup. It could eventually be something that YouTube goes into or something that Twitter goes into. Twitter has a ton of influencers too and lots of longtail experts. But I think the opportunity is still there, it is still so early enough that a new startup could take it.","Yeah, there's a lot of platforms out there that have a lot of users but they're not really use them such as YouTube and Twitter. But I think the opportunity is still there."
36,"Great. If you were to give, if you had one or two pieces of advice that you have for entrepreneurs in this space, what would it be?","Alright, what is your advice that you have for entrepreneurs at this moment?"
37,"This is probably contrarian view, even in Silicon Valley, but I would build for mobile first and I would build your app before you build your website because it will drastically unlock different ways of thinking. You will be able to use your GPS, your microphone, you'll be able to use a camera. And if those new additions or features don't help you brainstorm new things, then that’s a problem. You will be able to use in-app payments, right? You might be able to use Apple Pay and so forth. So I think one big thing I would say is if you're building for the future, consider building this platform first on mobile, even before you go to the PC now I know that's a very contrarian view. Because a lot of investors will also say go to the PC first, get your brand and then go to the app. But I think when you start at least brainstorming at the very least on a mobile platform first, it unlocks this idea - how can I use a microphone differently and then now that I have microphone and audio down pat, how can I use machine learning differently? Right and that allows you to unlock ideas like the Lingochamp for English learning, or like Payman for piano teaching, that honestly someone building for a PC will never get to that insight.","Yes, so the main point is if you are building for the future, build that platform first on mobile before you go to the PC. Even though the lot of investors prefer the PC firs. It will allow you to use modern educational and learning technologies in machine learning."
38,"Right. And then presumably, your next piece of advice would be experiment on the business model, right? So we've got mobile, we've got machine learning, and now it's like let's do something other than ads.","Okay now we have got mobile, we've got machine learning, and now it's like let's do something other than ads right."
39,"Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. I am not a fan of strictly ad based models, mostly because the ones that do succeed, say like a Facebook or Google. I mean, the reason their ads succeed is not because of the mass of pageviews. It's, it's also because of all the information they have on that user. So the ads are highly targeted. Right? And if you're a platform where you don't have such detailed information on your end users, your ads are not as valuable and they're not going to convert as well. So focusing on just building up pageviews and hoping to monetize with ads, to me is a scary strategy in general for any consumer app. But I think business model experimentation in the education space is huge because I mean a lot of these categories, like your skills for the doorknob, maybe it could sell you know similar doorknobs, they should have sold similar doorknobs, they should have sold you other home projects that hey, if you take this course, buy the components for at a discount, and that can be a partnership with your local Home Depot, because geographically they know the local Home Depot it's only two or three miles away from where you are. Right and those ideas are very possible and not being implemented today. Kind of thinking if this person learned this course, what else can I follow? Beyond just another course? What physical things can I sell them? What other services can I sell?","Exactly, and I think that's a great point. You know, a lot of these platforms, they, they can really get to know their users and understand what their interests are and then target them with relevant ads. And I think that's something that a lot of these education platforms are missing out on. You know, a lot of these platforms, they really need to focus on getting to know their users better and understanding what their interests are."
40,"It seems inevitable that as we continue into a world that rapidly changes, therefore needs new skills all the time, that the spending pattern here on education will flatten right. Which is the way I think about education spending over a lifetime today is kind of like there's an elephant inside of Python, right which is, you spent a lot of money and then you get to college where you have the 529 plan to help subsidize my tax deferred dollars to go to university. And then basically it drops to zero, right? It's sort of like a very small proportion of the population spends money on ongoing training. And if you spend it, it's mostly like, oh, work had me do it and then I expensed it, right, but it's nowhere approaching college tuition. So it's sort of this big sort of college expense in the middle. It feels like as we move into a new world, like we want to flatten that out, right. We want to give access to piano teaching for kids, smooth it out earlier in life, and then we sort of smooth it out later in life too. And that's going to require this business model experimentation,","I worry that, you know, our education system is becoming so expensive that it's going to choke our economy. And I think that we need to find ways to make education more affordable because, you know, the jobs of the future are going to require more education, not less. And so, you know, I think we need to find ways to make education more accessible to everyone. And that's going to require this business model experimentation."
41,"Business model experimentation and just making that information more accessible. Like if I told you, you could spend $15 and get 10 courses on how to improve your voice. Would you consider it? I am looking for voice instructors right now. I'd paid far more than that. But I feel like so many of these ideas or just people oftentimes just forget that they exist, because it's not so in their face, and it's not also done in bite-sized snacks, on their own schedule, on their own timeframe. When you're on a mobile platform when you're doing these bite-sized lessons, you can do it every morning.","Yeah, you should spend more money to where you can get best out of it but not in the things like to improve your voice. And you can work on your own schedule, on your own timeframe. When you're on a mobile platform when you're doing these bite-sized lessons, you can do it every morning."
42,"Yeah. Well, I personally can't wait for a lot of this stuff. As I mentioned, I love learning new things. And I can't wait to have very compelling products that are teaching me new things a little more sophisticated than how to replace a doorknob.",It’s really interesting and I really love to learn new things that is very useful for self-improvement.
43,"They should have also sold your services of a handyman nearby in case you fail. That's true, right? There's just so many ways you can monetize a simple video like replacing a doorknob that’s not being done today. Like all these ‘how to’ home fixes, a good chunk of people who attempt them can't do it and they're willing to pay.","There are a lot of people who are handy and can do these things, but there are also a lot of people who are not handy and would rather pay someone to do it for them. This is a service that many people would be willing to pay for."
44,"give up in the middle surrounded by an explosion of tools, right? I give up!",I would give up in the middle surrounded by an explosion of tools
45,"Or I'm maybe missing this part. Maybe I'm missing this wrench, the right power tool. Right? Right. You could have done this in half the time if you had this power tool. These ideas aren't being thought of right now because it’s the business model innovation, right? Think about not just selling them the next course and stuffing more ads into your courses and therefore making your video much longer than it needs to be - which is the game that a lot of these influencers have to play, they're being forced to play their game right now. Give them better ways to monetize what they're selling.","Or maybe I’m missing the right tool. You can done this if you have the right tool so, think about not just selling them the next course and stuffing more ads into your courses. Give them better ways to monetize what they're selling."
46,"Yeah. And that business model would be good because another age old problem with these education marketplaces that try to get broad - to have all of this content - is that the repeat usage is never as good as the entrepreneur hopes. So you kind of hope that I sell you the piano playing class and then you'll come to me for filmmaking or whatever it is. And it turns out in a lot of these, that you're almost capturing that customer again for the first time, even though they bought a class from you.","Exactly. And so, what we're trying to do is create a marketplace that is really focused on building a community of lifelong learners. It’s about getting them to come back to you for more classes, or more products, or more services right."
47,"Yeah. And so this point actually, I want to say I never a fan of subscription models, but for this category, I don't think subscription is necessarily the best model. Because for me to sign up for a subscription, I have to think I'm going to take more than one class. I mean, why not instead, let me pay per course. And for other courses, if you want to push discovery, allow me to sample the first 10 minutes of a class for free, or do some other kind of incentive to get me to see the value. And then maybe after two or three courses, then sell me something like a subscription where I'm like, yes, for sure. I'm going to use this multiple times over. But the idea of jumping from day one to push your subscription, I think is a hard business model for this category.","Exactly. And I think that that's a really good point. If you want to make me subscribed to the platform allow me to sample the first 10 minutes of a class for free, or do some other kind of incentive to get me to see the value. But if you are going to jump from day one to push your subscription, that’s not going to work in this business model."
48,"It's hard to hit. You have to capture the people who would pay up front for health clubs, right, which is sort of it's the aspirational me that will go to the gym all the time. Right. Well, thanks for joining us. We're so excited for the future of EdTech that is mobile first and AI enabled and isn't just advertising because I want to learn new stuff. I want to learn it all the time. The next thing I think in our house will be clearing clutter. And so it's fun, Marie Kondo has that series on Netflix now and so maybe I should watch it, and maybe there will be a tailor-made startup for that type of stuff. They can offer me help when I get stuck clearing my own crap. So All right, thanks, to you too. We'll see you next episode. If you liked what you saw, go ahead and comment and subscribe on the bottom. And we'll see you next episode.","Alright, well thanks for joining us.
